<h2>
What is this job?
</h2>
<p>
    A role based around developing programs, applications and other software using GIS, 
    a spatial/geographical based software. The projects involve working on previously 
    established work, which includes maintenance and optimisation of in-house programs. 
    What excites me about this role is working with people, projects and companies that would
    be passionate about, and also being able to work and communicate from home meaning
    no need to journey into the city every day.
    </p>

<h2>
    What does this job require?
    </h2>
<p>
    This role requires knowledge in GIS/Spatial, Python/Java, Javascript (Node/React), Postgre SQL,
and finds AWS API GAtways knowledge also desirable. Outside of programming knowledge, 
this requires key job components such as problem solving and communication skills.
</p>

<h2>
    What do I have? What do I need?
</h2>
<p>
    Of these requirements, I have already gathered problem solving and communication skills from
many various roles I have worked in the past, and expect to be able to practice and keep these skills
in the future.
</p>
<p>
Of the requirements I currently don’t posses, namely the coding/programming skills, I’d hope to be able
to learn, expand on and experience all of these through university study, placements and future
job opportunities in the IT pathway.
