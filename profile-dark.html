        The Myer Briggs Test
    </h1>
<h5>
    **I would like to preface this section of by stating I do not support the Myer-Briggs testing and I hope that one day it is no longer seen as necessary. I also believe the tests are based in many worrying racist undertones (Merve Emre, 2015), that much talking needs to be done about.** </h5>

    <p>
        That said, as I want to do well in this assignment, here are my test results:

<h2>
    What do these results mean for me?
</h2>

<p>
    The Myer-Briggs test, having done it before many times in my life, is different every time I take it.
I took it in last in February 2020, before the COVID lockdowns, and was an ENFJ-A...almost the
complete opposite of today’s results. I really doubt the authenticity of the test and especially the results
as it feels like some sort of horoscope based around confirmation bias to me.
</p>

<h1>
    The Online Learning Styles Test
</h1>

<h2>
    What do these results mean for me?
</h2>

<p>
    For the learning style test, while this may be playing into confirmation bias, this answer has been
consistent since primary school, where I was called a “kinetic” learner, and teachers would put
me in class with other “kinetic” learners as it made it easier to teach them.
</p>

<h1>
    The Australian Government Job Outlook Test
</h1>

<img src="img/joboutlooktest.png" alt="The results of the australian government's career test, which is disappointingly disappointing."></a>

<h2>
    What do these results mean for me?
</h2>

<p>
    For the final test I chose the Australian government’s Job Outlook Career Quiz, which I have
taken before. As before I find my results similar to previous results but still have no idea how
accurate they feel to me, as the top 3 jobs they “match” with me do not interest me at all.
</p>

<h2> 
    Final thoughts - refllection and future teams
</h2>

<p> 
    These results won’t influence my behaviour in a team because I have worked in many different
    teams before, of different subjects, careers and ethnic groups, and find myself being able to shift
    and fulfill different roles as the group requires.
</p>
<p>
    If I am being honest, I believe these pseudo-psychological tests really shouldn’t influence anyones decision
    making for team or career choices. When my career advisor took me through similar testing
    I ended up choosing a career pathway which led me to a brick wall and a lot of disappointment.
    Choosing outside of these tests will help more in any decision.
