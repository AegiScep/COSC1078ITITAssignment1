<h2>
About me
</h2>
<p>
   After I graduated from high school, I began a International Studies degree at Deakin University. My major was Chinese and during the degree, I studied in Shanghai, China for 6 months. After I returned, I changed my degree to a Business/International Studies double degree, but ultimately I found that despite all I studied I did not enjoy it nor found much future prospect for job. After 12 months of searching I ended up choosing IT at RMIT.

<h5>
    Interesting fact!
</h5>
<p>
    As of the day I am writing this, I have worked 28 different jobs since I turned 15, my most current (and longest) being a bartender role. My first job was as an AFL umpire.

<h2>
    My IT life
    </h2>

    <h4>
        Origins
    </h4>
    <p>
        My interest in IT started from two of my favourite properties as a kid; Disney’s Tron and the Digimon series. both of which feature elements of IT (but highly fantasized). Growing up, I really enjoyed and studied IT in secondary, but followed the advice of a “career advisor” not to go into IT because there would never be enough jobs in the industry. 
What brought me back to IT after choosing not to follow the IT pathway originally was my love of video games, but in my time I spent trying to learn how to make them I really started to re-enjoy and that feeling was what led me to go back to university for IT.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Experience
    </h4>
    <P>
        In terms of experience, hardware-wise I was always the Family handyman for internet and computer problems that occurred. Which happened quite frequently as my parents and their parents were very clueless when it came to anything IT.
Recently, my experience has been in being interested in, beginning and then never working on projects such as coding, app making, website-making, game making etc. I’ve always wanted to make a video game, and have via RPG Maker, Unity and other programs, but have found more enjoyment with the code side then the actual game design part.
    </P>

    <h4>
        What now?
    </h4>
    <p>
        RMIT ended up being my university of choice because of the positive experience I had heard from my fellow friends and family who had studied and graduated from the university. On top of that, I have had negative experiences with other unis (which I shall not name). Originally, the location was also part of the choice but in the post-covid world, the location has not affected my choice and I was still glad to choose RMIT. 
    </p>
        <p>
            From my studies, I am hoping to be able to learning new, and different coding languages, as well as different ways that I could pursue careers in IT (cybersecurity has already caught my attention).
